## Andriod project
The Android application is a modular app that gives users the choice to choose one of the games and one demo project that represents the ability to work with an accelerometer<br>
The project includes: 
* Wordle game
* Rock paper scissors
* Accelerometer game (you just need to shake a phone)

>[!NOTE]
>All PHP projects (except the laravel final project) are required to have a docker-compose file and Docker itself to launch them.<br>
>For the Laravel project utilize `composer install` -> `php artisan migrate:fresh` (or `php arisan migrate`) ->  `php artisan storage:link` -> `php artisan serve` commands in this particular sequence to launch the app.
