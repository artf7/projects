## Andriod project
The Android application is a modular app that gives users the choice to choose one of the games and one demo project that represents the ability to work with an accelerometer<br>
The project includes: 
* Wordle game
* Rock paper scissors
* Accelerometer game (you just need to shake a phone)

>All PHP projects (except the laravel final project) are required to have a docker-compose file and Docker itself to launch them.<br>
>For the Laravel project use `composer install` `php artisan serve` commands to launch the server and open the app.
