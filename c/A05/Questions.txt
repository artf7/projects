Question:
1. Difference between #include <sqlite3.h> and #include "sqlite3.h".
	#include <sqlite3.h> is standard library header. <> The preprocessor searches in an 
	implementation-defined manner, normally in directories pre-designated by the compiler/IDE. 
	This method is normally used to include header files for the C standard library and other header 
	files associated with the target platform.
	#include "sqlite3.h" is user defined header. The preprocessor also searches in an implementation-defined manner, 
	but one that is normally used to include programmer-defined header files and typically includes same directory as 
	the file containing the directive (unless an absolute path is given).
	

2. What is static library?
	Static library is a compiled object file containing all symbols required by the main program to operate 
	(functions, variables etc.) as opposed to having to pull in separate entities.
	
3. What is a dynamic link library in Windows? What or is there an equivalent in Linux? 
	DLL is Microsoft's implementation of the shared library concept. A DLL file contains code and 
	data that can be used by multiple programs at the same time, hence it promotes code reuse and modularization.
	An equivalent in Linux systems is shared objects (*.so).
